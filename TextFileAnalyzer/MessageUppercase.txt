HELLO THERE,
I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RECENT DIFFICULTIES. FEELING OVERWHELMED IS NORMAL; YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE. KEEP IN MIND THAT EVERY OBSTACLE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEVELOPMENT AND THAT EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES OCCASIONALLY IS QUITE NATURAL.
REMEMBER TO TREAT YOURSELF WITH KINDNESS. HONOR THE MINOR TRIUMPHS AND TAKE PAUSES WHEN NECESSARY. EVERYTHING IS A PART OF THE TRIP.
SEEK ASSISTANCEâ€”FRIENDS RELATIVES, OR INSTRUCTORS CAN BE EXCELLENT MOTIVATORS.
THERE ARE BETTER DAYS AHEAD, AND YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH TO OVERCOME THIS. CONTINUE TO ADVANCE, ONE STEP AT A TIME.
YOU'RE CAPABLE!
